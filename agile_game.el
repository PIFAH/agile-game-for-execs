;; This is an attempt to quickly program a an Agile game.

;; This is basically a card game.  I'm going to program up the "cards" here
;; into a series of "decks".  There will be 6 turns in the game. After each turn,
;; The user can assign teams to projects.  The point of the game is to get a maximum
;; score based on reach user satisfaction goals.

;; Every card starts with a title, a unique symobl and then includes functions that are to be applied in some way.
