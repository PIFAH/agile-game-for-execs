# agile-game-for-execs

This is a game that simulates the resource decisions that an executive makes when running several Agile projects at the same time.
It shamelessly attempts to advocate for Agile methods by showing the advantages of such methods.

I'm writing it first in Emacs Lisp until I get the mechanics right. Later it will be presented as a javacript/D3 implementation,
so that it requires no sever-side presence.
